## Academic History and Education Background

I received my **Bachelor’s degree in Software Engineering** from **Daffodil International University**, Bangladesh, in **2018**. In **September 2019**, I was awarded the **Chinese Government Scholarship** and moved to China to pursue graduate studies. I completed my **Master’s degree in Information and Communication Engineering** at **Donghua University**, Shanghai, China, in **2022**. Following my master’s studies, I was awarded the **Shanghai Government Scholarship** to pursue my **PhD** at **Donghua University**. I am currently a PhD student in the **Information and Communication Intelligent Systems** program, where my research focuses on data-driven methods for **3D plant phenotyping, point cloud learning, and intelligent visual analysis**.

### 3D-NOD: 3D New Organ Detection in Plant Growth by a Spatiotemporal Point Cloud Deep Segmentation Framework

Dawei Li†, **Foysal Ahmed**†, Z. Wang† <br>
<strong>Plant Phenomics</strong>, 2025.<br>
† Contributed equally.

**Brief Description:**  
This paper presents a spatiotemporal deep learning framework for detecting newly emerged plant organs from 4D point cloud sequences.  
By jointly modeling spatial structure and temporal growth dynamics, the proposed method enables accurate and robust organ-level analysis during plant development.
